It's recommended to use constant variables than hard-coding them everywhere.
For example, if you decide to change the command from '.circuit' to '.start' later,
    you only need to change the constant

It's a good practice to check if the user has given required and only the required inputs
Otherwise, show them the expected usage.

In this case, the open function will throw an IOError.

Here, the actual work is done in a single line (before "# print output").
It takes care of
    1. Removing comments
    2. Splitting the words
    3. Reversing words
    4. Reversing lines
    
Compare this with how you would do the same in a C code.
